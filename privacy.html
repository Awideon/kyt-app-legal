        <h1>Privacy Policy for Kyt</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: [Date of Last Update]</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Kyt ("the App"), provided by [Your Name or Company Name] ("we", "our", "us"). Kyt is designed to be your personal and household operations manual, helping you organize, track, and manage your life's important information. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We have designed Kyt to be a "local-first" application, meaning the core data you create is stored primarily on your own device. We only collect the information necessary to provide and improve the app's features.</p>
        
        <h3>Information You Provide Directly to Us:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and a securely hashed version of your password for authentication purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any and all data you voluntarily enter into the app. This includes, but is not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Names and details of your "Kyts" (e.g., "Home Kyt," "Car Kyt").</li>
                    <li>Details of items within your Kyts, such as brand names, model numbers, serial numbers, purchase dates, warranty information, and other custom fields.</li>
                    <li>Activity and Event logs, including descriptions, dates, costs, and notes.</li>
                    <li>Contact information for service providers you add to your Services Hub.</li>
                    <li>Photos and documents (e.g., receipts, manuals) that you choose to upload. This media is stored locally within the app's secure directory on your device.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how you interact with the app, such as feature usage, performance metrics, and crash reports. This data is not linked to your personal identity and is used solely to help us identify bugs and improve the user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used to provide, maintain, and improve the features of Kyt.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Core App Functionality:</strong> Your user-generated content is used to display your Kyts, items, and events, and to power the on-device "Big Brain" reminder system.</li>
            <li><strong>For Authentication:</strong> Your email address is used to sign you in, send email verification links, and provide password reset functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>For Kyt Premium Features (if subscribed):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Sync & Backup:</strong> For premium users, your user-generated content is securely synchronized with Google's Firebase Firestore database to enable multi-device access and serve as a backup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharing & Collaboration:</strong> When you share a Kyt or a Service Provider with another person, we use their email address to create and manage the invitation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Access:</strong> We store the email address of your designated Digital Executor to facilitate the secure transfer of your account in an emergency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third-party marketers.</strong> Your privacy is paramount. Information is only shared in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use Google Firebase as our backend infrastructure for authentication and cloud storage (for Premium users). Google's use of this information is governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> By default, all of your user-generated content is stored exclusively on your device in a private, secure application directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage (Premium):</strong> For Kyt Premium subscribers, this data is also stored securely in Google's Firebase Firestore database, protected by Firebase's robust security rules and infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We use standard security measures, including HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your device and our servers. The optional on-device "App Lock" feature provides an additional layer of security on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Your Data Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update your information at any time directly within the Kyt app.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete any of your content (Kyts, Items, Events, etc.) at any time. Deleting content from the app will also delete it from our cloud servers if you are a premium subscriber.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Kyt is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
