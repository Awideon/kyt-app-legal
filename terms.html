        <h1>Terms of Service for Kyt</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: July 28, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Kyt mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App. These Terms are a legal agreement between you and NovaSphere Studio ("we", "our", "us").</p>

        <h2>2. The Kyt Service</h2>
        <p>Kyt is a personal and household operations manual designed to help you organize, track, and manage important information ("the Service"). The Service includes a free tier with on-device storage and a premium subscription tier ("Kyt Premium") with additional features.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service or any of its features at any time, with or without notice to you. **The appearance, layout, and functionality of the App may change over time as we introduce new features, respond to user feedback, and improve the user experience.**</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use a strong password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. You are also responsible for the security of your on-device App Lock PIN, which is stored locally and is not accessible by us.</p>

        <h2>4. Kyt Premium Subscription</h2>
        <p>Kyt offers a premium subscription that unlocks features such as cloud sync, sharing, and legacy access. All subscriptions are managed and billed through the third-party platform from which you downloaded the App (e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play Store). Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it through your app store account settings. All payments are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective app store, and we do not issue refunds.</p>

        <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all the information, data, text, and media that you create and store within Kyt ("User Content"). We do not claim any ownership rights over your User Content.</p>
        <p>By using the Service (specifically Kyt Premium cloud features), you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, store, and reproduce your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and operating the Service for you. You are solely responsible for your User Content and for any consequences of posting or publishing it.</p>

        <h2>6. Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) attempting to interfere with or compromise the system integrity or security; (ii) reverse-engineering the App; (iii) using the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose; (iv) uploading any content that is unlawful, harmful, or infringes on the rights of others.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Sharing and Legacy Access Features</h2>
        <p>Kyt provides features that allow you to share your data with other users or designate a Digital Executor. You are solely responsible for who you invite and the level of permission you grant. We are not responsible for and disclaim all liability for any actions taken by individuals you have granted access to your account or data.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. In no event shall NovaSphere Studio be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Ghana, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any significant changes. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
